# Synchronizer in Trinity-RFT

The **Synchronizer** is the central coordination module in **Trinity-RFT**, designed to keep the **Trainer** and **Explorer** components in sync when training reinforcement learning models in a distributed environment. Its main purpose is to ensure that both components are always working with up-to-date model weights, enabling efficient and stable learning.

Think of it like a traffic controller: it manages when and how the Explorer (which collects experience from the environment) updates its policy based on the latest model improvements made by the Trainer. Without this coordination, the system could become inefficient or even unstable due to outdated or conflicting model versions.

## How It Works: The Big Picture

In Trinity-RFT:

- The **Trainer** learns from collected data and updates the model.
- The **Explorer** uses the current model to interact with the environment and generate new data.
- The **Synchronizer** ensures these two stay aligned by managing **when** and **how** the Explorer gets the latest model weights.

To achieve this, the Synchronizer:
- Monitors the state of both Trainer and Explorer.
- Decides when synchronization should occur.
- Coordinates the transfer of model weights using one of several strategies.

### Inside the Trainer

```python
async def train(self) -> str:
    while self.train_step_num < self.total_steps:
        try:
            # sample may be blocked due to explorer does not generate enough data
            self.logger.info(f"Sample data for step {self.train_step_num + 1} started.")
            sample_task = asyncio.create_task(self._sample_data())
            while not sample_task.done():
                # sync weight to make sure the explorer can continue to explore and generate enough data
                if await self.need_sync():
                    # Currently, we do not record the metrics of sync_weight here
                    await self.sync_weight()
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
            exps, metrics, repr_samples = await sample_task
            self.logger.info(f"Sample data for step {self.train_step_num + 1} finished.")
            metrics.update(await self.train_step(exps))
            if await self.need_sync():
                metrics.update(await self.sync_weight())
            # ...
            self.monitor.log(metrics, self.train_step_num)
        except StopAsyncIteration:
            self.logger.info("No more samples to train. Stopping training.")
            break
        except Exception:
            self.logger.error(f"Error in Trainer:\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
            break
```

The Trainer checks whether synchronization is needed:
- During data collection in training.
- After completing each training step.

If so, it triggers `sync_weight()` through the Synchronizer.

### Inside the Explorer

```python
async def explore(self) -> str:
    while True:
        try:
            self.logger.info(f"Explore step {self.explore_step_num + 1} started.")
            explore_continue = await self.explore_step()
            if not explore_continue:
                break
            if self.need_eval():
                await self.eval()
            if await self.need_sync():
                await self.sync_weight()  # Request latest weights via Synchronizer
        except Exception:
            self.logger.error(f"Error in Explorer: {traceback.format_exc()}")
            break
```

The Explorer checks for synchronization:
- After finishing an exploration step.
- Before starting the next round of data collection.

This ensures it always uses a recent version of the model to generate high-quality experiences.

> ✅ **Key Insight**:
> Both Trainer and Explorer consult the Synchronizer regularly. This forms a **tight feedback loop**, keeping training and exploration in sync.

## Synchronization Methods: How Are Weights Shared?

There are **three ways** the model weights can be transferred from Trainer to Explorer, each suited to different environments.

| Method | Medium | Best For | Latency | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `NCCL` | GPU-to-GPU (Direct) | Same machine, multi-GPU | ⬇️ Lowest | Fastest, but requires shared hardware |
| `MEMORY` | Shared Memory / Network | Distributed clusters | ⬇️ Low | Good balance of speed and flexibility |
| `CHECKPOINT` | Disk Files | Cross-device, cloud, or slow systems | ⬆️ Higher | Most compatible, but slower |

### 1. `SyncMethod.NCCL` – High-Speed Direct Sync
- Uses NVIDIA’s **NCCL library** for direct GPU-to-GPU communication.
- Extremely fast — ideal when Trainer and Explorer run on the same node.
- Synchronizer helps set up communication groups and coordinates the sync.

🟢 **Use Case**: Multi-GPU clusters with high-speed interconnect setups.

---

### 2. `SyncMethod.CHECKPOINT` – Disk-Based Sync
- Trainer saves model weights to disk at regular intervals.
- Synchronizer reads the saved checkpoint.
- Explorer pulls the weights from Synchronizer.

🟡 **Use Case**: Distributed environments where nodes don’t share memory or GPUs (e.g., cloud clusters), especially with fast storage.

> 💡 Advantage: Fully decoupled — components can run independently across machines/platforms.

---

### 3. `SyncMethod.MEMORY` – In-Memory Sync
- Trainer sends model weights directly to Synchronizer in memory (via network or shared memory).
- Explorer fetches them from Synchronizer without touching disk.

🟢 **Use Case**: Multi-node clusters where disk I/O is slow, but network bandwidth is sufficient.

> ⚖️ Balances performance and compatibility better than CHECKPOINT.

## Synchronization Styles: When Does Sync Happen?

There are **two synchronization styles** that define *when* the Explorer requests updated weights.

### 1. `SyncStyle.FIXED` – Regular Intervals

- Synchronization happens every fixed number of steps.
- Configured with `sync_interval` and `sync_offset`.

| Example | Behavior |
|--------|---------|
| `interval=10, offset=0` | Sync every 10 steps (both start together) |
| `interval=10, offset=5` | Explorer runs 5 steps first, then sync every 10 steps |

✅ **Best for**: Simple, predictable environments where exploration steps are short and rewards are frequent (e.g., mathematical reasoning tasks).

> 🔁 Think of it as a metronome — steady and regular.

---

### 2. `SyncStyle.DYNAMIC_BY_EXPLORER` – Demand-Driven Sync

- Explorer decides to request a sync after generating a certain amount of data.
- It tells Synchronizer: _"I’m ready for a new model!"_
- Trainer checks this request during its normal loop and responds accordingly.

📌 **Process Flow**:
1. Explorer finishes `N` steps → sets state to `REQUIRE_SYNC`.
2. Waits for Trainer to acknowledge and perform sync.
3. Once synced, returns to `RUNNING`.
4. If timeout occurs, retries on next step.

✅ **Best for**: Complex, long-horizon tasks where data generation is expensive or variable (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing).

> 🔄 More flexible — adapts to actual data throughput.

---

## State Management: What’s Going On Behind the Scenes?

The Synchronizer tracks the **state** of both Trainer and Explorer to manage synchronization safely.

### Four Key States

| State | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `STOPPED` | Component has stopped working |
| `RUNNING` | Actively training or exploring |
| `REQUIRE_SYNC` | Explorer wants new weights |
| `WAITING_SYNC` | Explorer or Trainer is waiting synchronization (used in NCCL mode) |

These states help prevent race conditions and ensure smooth coordination.

### State Transitions by Style & Method

#### 🔹 Fixed Style + NCCL Sync
- Synchronizer schedules sync every `N` steps.
- Both sides pause briefly for direct GPU sync.
- The state of the trainer toggles predictably between `RUNNING` ↔ `WAITING_SYNC`, and the state of the explorer toggles among `RUNNING` → `REQUIRE_SYNC` → `WAITING_SYNC`.

![FIXED_STYLE_NCCL_SYNC](../../assets/FIXED-NCCL.png)

#### 🔹 Fixed Style + CHECKPOINT/MEMORY
- Trainer saves or sends weights periodically.
- Explorer checks at each interval and pulls updates.
- The state of the trainer remains at `RUNNING`, and the state of the explorer toggles between `RUNNING` ↔ `REQUIRE_SYNC`.

![FIXED_STYLE_STATEDICT_SYNC](../../assets/FIXED-STATEDICT.png)


#### 🔹 Dynamic Style + NCCL
- Explorer signals `REQUIRE_SYNC` after enough data.
- Trainer sees the signal and initiates NCCL sync.
- The state of the trainer toggles predictably between `RUNNING` ↔ `WAITING_SYNC`, and the state of the explorer toggles between `RUNNING` → `REQUIRE_SYNC` → `WAITING_SYNC`.

![DYN_STYLE_NCCL_SYNC](../../assets/DYN-NCCL.png)

#### 🔹 Dynamic Style + CHECKPOINT/MEMORY
- Explorer signals `REQUIRE_SYNC` after enough data.
- Trainer sees the signal and pushes weights to synchronizer.
- The state of the trainer remains at `RUNNING`, and the state of the explorer toggles between `RUNNING` ↔ `REQUIRE_SYNC`.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Which synchronization method should I choose?

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|--------|-------------------|
| Multi-GPU clusters with high-speed interconnect setups | `NCCL` |
| Multi-node cluster, fast memory/network | `MEMORY` |
| Multi-node, slow disk or unreliable network | `CHECKPOINT` |
| Maximum compatibility (cross-platform) | `CHECKPOINT` |

> ✅ **Rule of thumb**:
> Use `NCCL` if possible. Fall back to `MEMORY` or `CHECKPOINT` based on infrastructure.

---

### Q2: Which synchronization style is better?

| Use Case | Recommended Style |
|--------|------------------|
| Short episodes, quick feedback (e.g., math QA) | `FIXED` |
| Long interactions, delayed rewards (e.g., games, conversations) | `DYNAMIC_BY_EXPLORER` |

> 💡 `DYNAMIC_BY_EXPLORER` gives more control to the data-generating side, making it better for unbalanced or variable workloads.
