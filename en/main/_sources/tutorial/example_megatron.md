# Megatron-LM Backend

This guide walks you through how to train models using **Megatron-LM** in a clear way.

```{note}
This guide assumes you have already set up your environment from source code following {ref}`Installation <Installation>`. If you haven't done so, please refer to that guide first.
```

## Step 1: Install Megatron-LM Support

Install the project in editable mode with Megatron support:

```bash
pip install -e ".[megatron]"

# for uv
# uv sync -extra megatron
```

Then, install NVIDIA's Apex library for mixed-precision training:

```bash
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation \
    --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" \
    --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" \
    --resume-retries 10 git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
```

### Alternative: Use Docker

We provide a Docker setup to simplify environment management.

#### Build the Docker Image


Trinity-RFT provides a dedicated Dockerfile for Megatron-LM located at `scripts/docker/Dockerfile.megatron`. You can build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -f scripts/docker/Dockerfile.megatron -t trinity-rft-megatron:latest .
```

> 💡 You can customize the Dockerfile before building — for example, to add pip mirrors or set API keys.

#### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -it \
    --gpus all \
    --shm-size="64g" \
    --rm \
    -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -v <your_data_and_checkpoints_path>:/data \
    trinity-rft-megatron:latest
```

Replace `<your_data_and_checkpoints_path>` with the actual path on your machine where datasets and model checkpoints are stored.

## Step 2: Configure and Run Training

Most configuration settings are covered in the [Quick Start Guide](./example_reasoning_basic.md). Here, we'll focus only on **Megatron-LM-specific** settings.

### Megatron Configuration Example

Below is an example of how to configure the actor, reference model, and critic to use Megatron-LM:

```yaml
actor_rollout_ref:
  ...
  actor:
    strategy: megatron  # Kept for backward compatibility
    megatron:
      # Model parallelism settings
      tensor_model_parallel_size: 2
      pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1
      expert_model_parallel_size: 1

      # Offloading (set to false unless you're memory-constrained)
      param_offload: false
      grad_offload: false
      optimizer_offload: false

      # Use mBridge for parameter import/export (optional)
      use_mbridge: false

      # Use Megatron checkpoint
      use_dist_checkpointing: false
      dist_checkpointing_path: null

      # Recomputation settings (helps save memory during training)
      override_transformer_config:
        recompute_granularity: full
        recompute_method: uniform
        recompute_num_layers: 1
  ...
  ref:
    megatron:
      tensor_model_parallel_size: 2
      pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1
      expert_model_parallel_size: 1
      param_offload: false
      grad_offload: false
      optimizer_offload: false
      use_mbridge: false
      use_dist_checkpointing: false
      dist_checkpointing_path: null
      override_transformer_config:
        recompute_granularity: full
        recompute_method: uniform
        recompute_num_layers: 1
  ...

critic:
  strategy: megatron
  megatron:
    tensor_model_parallel_size: 2
    pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1
    expert_model_parallel_size: 1
    param_offload: false
    grad_offload: false
    optimizer_offload: false
    use_mbridge: false
    use_dist_checkpointing: false
    dist_checkpointing_path: null
    override_transformer_config:
      recompute_granularity: full
      recompute_method: uniform
      recompute_num_layers: 1
  ...
```

### Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models

If you're training an MoE model like **Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B**, you’ll need to take one of the following two approaches to ensure it works properly:

1. **Use MBridge (Recommended)**:
   Simply set `use_mbridge: true` in your configuration file. This enables the necessary support for MoE models directly.

2. **Convert the model manually**:
   If you prefer not to use MBridge, set `use_mbridge: false`. Before training, you must first convert your Hugging Face model to the MCore format using the [Hugging Face to MCore converter](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/scripts/converter_hf_to_mcore.py) from the **verl** repository. After conversion, update your config with:
   - `use_dist_checkpointing: true`
   - `dist_checkpointing_path: /PATH/TO/CONVERTED/MODEL/`

> ⚠️ Important: If you skip both steps, the MoE model may fail to load or train correctly. Make sure to follow one of the two options above.
