### Step 0: Basic Concepts of Operator Module

In Trinity-RFT, the operator module is responsible for processing experience data in the buffer module. It supports existing data processing capabilities from [Data-Juicer](https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer) naturally, and allows developers to implement their own operators as well.
By customizing operators, developers can implement various data processing functionalities, such as data augmentation, filtering, and transformation. You can even implement advantages/returns calculation as operators, as shown in {ref}`Algorithms <Algorithms>` section.

- **DataJuicerOperator** ({class}`trinity.buffer.operators.DataJuicerOperator`): The operator that wraps the data processing operators from Data-Juicer. It provides a simple interface for developers to list the Data-Juicer operators they want to use. The full list of Data-Juicer operators can be found [here](https://modelscope.github.io/data-juicer/en/main/docs/Operators.html).
- **ExperienceOperator** ({class}`trinity.buffer.operators.ExperienceOperator`): The base class for all operators used in experience data processing. It defines the interface and common functionalities that all operators should have. Each operator processes a batch of experience data and returns the processed data with metrics for logging.
- **ExperiencePipeline** ({class}`trinity.buffer.pipelines.ExperiencePipeline`): The experience data processing pipeline that manages a sequence of operators. It takes raw experiences from the `Explorer`, passes them through each operator in the pipeline, and writes the final processed experiences into the input buffer of the `Trainer`.

```{note}
Except for `ExperiencePipeline`, Trinity-RFT also provides `TaskPipeline` for task data processing.
In the current version, the `TaskPipeline` only supports using Data-Juicer operators. Please see this {ref}`section <Data Processing>` for details.
```

Developers can implement and use their own operators by following the steps below.

### Step 1: Implement Operator

The `ExperienceOperator` interface includes only one `process` method. The `ExperiencePipeline` will call this method with a list of `Experience` generated by the `Explorer` in one explore step. The `process` method should return a tuple containing the processed list of `Experience` and a dictionary of metrics for logging.

```python
class ExperienceOperator(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, exps: List[Experience]) -> Tuple[List[Experience], Dict]:
        """Process a list of experiences and return a transformed list.

        Args:
            exps (List[Experience]): List of experiences to process, which contains
                all experiences generated by the Explorer in one explore step.
        Returns:
            Tuple[List[Experience], Dict]: A tuple containing the processed list of experiences and a dictionary of metrics.
        """
```

Here is an implementation of a simple operator that filters out experiences with rewards below a certain threshold:

```python
from trinity.buffer.operators import ExperienceOperator
from trinity.common.experience import Experience


class RewardFilter(ExperienceOperator):

    def __init__(self, threshold: float = 0.0) -> None:
        self.threshold = threshold

    def process(self, exps: List[Experience]) -> Tuple[List[Experience], Dict]:
        filtered_exps = [exp for exp in exps if exp.reward >= self.threshold]
        metrics = {"filtered_count": len(exps) - len(filtered_exps)}
        return filtered_exps, metrics
```

After implementation, you need to register this module through {class}`trinity.buffer.operators.EXPERIENCE_OPERATORS`. Once registered, the module can be configured in the configuration file using the registered name.

### Step 2: Use Your Operator

After completing the above steps, you can use the newly registered operator through a YAML configuration file.

```yaml
# some other configs
data_processor:
  experience_pipeline:
    operators:
      - name: "reward_filter"
        args:
          threshold: 0.1
synchronizer:
  sync_method: nccl
  sync_style: dynamic_by_explorer
  sync_interval: 2
# some other configs
```

```{tip}
The `RewardFilter` reduces the number of experiences, which may cause the trainer can't get enough experiences to start a training step. To avoid the issue, you can use the advanced {ref}`Dynamic Synchronization <Synchronizer>` feature provided by Trinity-RFT as shown in the above configuration file.
The above setting means that the `Explorer` will sync with the `Trainer` every 2 steps and will continue running regardless of how many steps the `Trainer` has completed. This ensures that the `Trainer` can always get enough experiences to start a training step as long as the `Explorer` is running.
```
